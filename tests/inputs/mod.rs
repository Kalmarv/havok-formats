//! The real-data inputs this crate's tests read, each with what it is, where it comes from and whether a run that
//! requires every gate input fails without it (`primase_testdata::inputs!`; README.md here lists them). Integration tests reach it
//! with `mod inputs;`, unit tests with `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "../tests/inputs/mod.rs"] mod inputs;` in the
//! crate root, and tests/real_data_inputs.rs checks that every query the crate's sources write is declared
//! here. Declare an input here when a test first asks for it.
