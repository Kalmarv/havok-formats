# Changelog

## Unreleased

Spline compression written as well as read: the stored block values kept exactly, an encoder, and an animation written
into its file.

- `spline::SplineBlocks` (`read`, `write`, `guard_applies`) and its value types (`BlockData`, `TrackData`, `VectorData`,
  `ScalarData`, `RotationData`, `QuaternionData`, `PackedQuaternion`, `FloatData`, `ScalarQuantization`,
  `WrittenBlocks`): what a block stores, kept exactly (each part's whole flag byte, the quantization codes also of an
  absent rotation, the bounds, the quantized integers, the packed quaternions, the 16 guard bytes), and laid out again.
  Every one of the 60,209 spline animations of both installs (Sekiro 11,581, Elden Ring 48,628) is written back byte for
  byte, the guard bytes exactly where Elden Ring has them (4,975). `SplineAnimation::parse` reads through it (same
  refusals and messages); `SplineAnimation::decode` decodes stored values. `RotationQuantization::code`.
- `spline::encode` and `encode_blocks`: an interleaved animation compressed as a spline compressed one, with
  `TrackParams` (tolerances, degrees and quantizations of each part; `Default` and `TrackParams::compress_anim` are
  `CompressAnim.exe`'s) and `EncodeParams` (frames a block, one `TrackParams` a track, the guard bytes, the arithmetic:
  `Flavor::Games` or `Flavor::CompressAnim`). An error-bounded B-spline fit (*The NURBS Book* A9.10) in f32; no Havok
  code. Re-encoding the decoded frames of every stock animation that stores no NaN (60,193) gives its stored header bit
  for bit and 892 Sekiro and 4,554 Elden Ring animations byte for byte. With `EncodeParams::compress_anim`, the synthetic
  cases of tests/compress_anim.rs get CompressAnim's header, layout, flags and knots, two of them byte for byte (the
  others differ in the last bits of fitted values: the tool fits in x87 extended precision).
- `SplineAnimation::locate_frame`, `sample_frame`, `sample_float_frame` and `interleaved`: every track at every stored
  frame, the interleaved form.
- `animation::replace_animation`: an animation written over the one a file stores (same class and track counts), the
  rest of the file kept, as a `TagfileImage` to write. Put back unchanged, a stock file comes back byte for byte.

Packfiles: versions 9 and 11, the image and writer, the class metadata, and the half float. Checked on the games' own
files: the 490 Tony Hawk's SHRED packfiles (version 7) and the 35 distinct packfiles of Sekiro (29) and Elden Ring (6)
(versions 9 and 11) are read, imaged and written back byte for byte (`tests/packfile_image.rs`), and the eight SHRED
ragdoll files that carry their classes are read into a class table whose signatures and offsets are checked against what
the files store (`tests/reflection.rs`).

- `packfile::Packfile::read` reads versions 9 (`hk_2013.1.0-r1`) and 11 (`hk_2014.1.0-r1`): 8-byte pointers, little endian,
  48- and 64-byte section headers, the version 11 predicate region (`Packfile::predicate_region`). New fields `version`,
  `rules` (`packfile::Rules`) and `contents_version`; `u16`, `u32`, `f32`, `pointer` and `array_header` follow the file's
  byte order and pointer width; `Packfile::word`, `simple_array` and `types` (the same view of `__types__`) are new.
  The class-signature table still holds the version 7 files to the 7.1 definitions only. The physics views refuse any
  file but version 7.
- `packfile::image`: `Packfile::image` makes a `PackfileImage` (objects as trees of byte blocks with their pointer slots,
  the `__types__` objects, the header words) and `PackfileImage::write` lays it out again by the rules the games' files
  follow (object order, run alignment, packed string arrays, fixup order and padding, class-name order), so an unedited
  file comes back byte for byte.
- `packfile::reflection`: `ClassTable::from_packfile` reads the `hkClass`, `hkClassMember` and `hkClassEnum` objects of a
  `__types__` section (the schema for any class table: `Class`, `Member`, `Enum`, `MemberType`); `ClassTable::signature`
  recomputes a class signature (all 96 stored signatures of the eight SHRED files reproduce) and `ClassTable::layout`
  gives member offsets and sizes from the member lists under `Rules` (all 2,296 stored offsets and 544 class sizes).
- `Value::half` reads an `hkHalf16` (the top 16 bits of an `f32`), `HALF_FORMAT` names its format word.
- Tests: hostile-input checks of the packfile readers on hand-made files of all three layouts and on real files
  (truncation at 200 places is refused, 2,000 flipped bytes panic nothing, garbage is not a packfile); the class versions
  of both games' type tables (`tests/class_versions.rs`).
- Breaking: the refusals for other packfile versions say `(7, 9 and 11 only)`; the pointer-size, byte-order and
  layout-rule refusals say `in version N`. `Game::Shred` and three `havok-packfiles` oracle sets are declared in the test inputs.

## 0.8.0 (2026-10-28)

Cloth (`cloth`) reads the whole `hclClothData`: what a cloth runtime needs, checked on every distinct tagfile with cloth
of both installs (149 Sekiro, 814 Elden Ring), none refused (`tests/cloth_corpus.rs` asserts the counts; a generic
census of every `hcl` object of the same files finds the same object counts).

- `Cloth` adds `buffers` (`BufferDefinition` with its `BufferLayout`; scratch and shadow buffers by `BufferKind`),
  `transform_sets`, `operators`, `states` (`ClothState` with buffer and transform set usage and its `DependencyGraph`),
  `state_transitions` and `actions` (by class).
- `SimCloth` reads all 29 members: simulation info (`gravity`, `global_damping_per_second`), `do_normals`,
  `sim_op_ids`, anti-pinch sets, `collidable_transform_map`, `collidables` (`Collidable` with its `Shape`: sphere,
  capsule, tapered capsule, plane, convex geometry), collision masks, transfer motion, landscape collision, the
  triangles (`triangle_indices`, `triangle_flips`), pinch data and `virtual_collision_points`.
- `ConstraintSet` is a struct (`name`, `constraint_id`: Elden Ring only, `kind`); `ConstraintKind` has a variant per
  class: standard, stretch, compressible and bend links, bend stiffness, local range, transition and `VolumeMx`.
- `Operator` (`name`, `id`, `operator_type`, buffer and transform set usage, `kind`): `OperatorKind` reads simulate (its
  configs), move particles, object- and bone-space skinning and mesh-mesh deformation (P, PN, PNT: deformer blend blocks,
  control bytes, packed and unpacked local blocks), simple and weighted mesh-bone deformation, vertex copies and gathers,
  input and output conversion, and all and some vertex frame updates.
- New checks: every particle index a sim cloth stores (its triangles, every constraint kind's particles, the virtual
  collision points' particles, a move particles operator's particles) is below the sim cloth's particle count; every
  index into the cloth data's buffers, transform sets, operators and sim cloths is below the list's length; a move
  particles vertex, a local range or transition reference vertex, and a vertex copy's range are inside their buffer; a
  sim cloth stores whole triangles; a collidable transform map has a bone and an offset for each collidable.
- Breaking: `cloth::ConstraintSet` and `cloth::Link` changed shape (`Link` has no `compression_length` or `stretch`;
  compressible and bend links are `CompressibleLink` and `BendLink`); `cloth.rs` became the `cloth` module directory.

## 0.7.0 (2026-10-27)

The checks and members a census of the 490 Tony Hawk's SHRED packfiles and of every Sekiro and Elden Ring tagfile
settled. Each new refusal is of an input none of those files has: a read of the 490 packfiles (1,470 sections) refuses
none, and a read of both installs (19,137 + 68,722 distinct tagfiles, 16 + 36 compendia) refuses none.

Packfiles (`packfile`, `packfile::physics`):

- Container: a section header's byte 19 is `0xFF` and the bytes between the tag's NUL and byte 19 are zero (1,470
  headers); a fixup source is 4-byte aligned, a local fixup's target 4-byte and a global fixup's 16-byte aligned, and an
  object starts on a 16-byte boundary (all 130,610 fixups and 47,915 objects). An array header's capacity word is
  exactly `size | 0x80000000` and an empty array has no fixup; a pointer slot that has a fixup holds zero, as one without
  does (every array and pointer the views read; the census found no exception in 114,784 array headers and 487,981
  pointer slots).
- A packfile this reader refuses is named. The refusal for its version, pointer size, byte order, layout rules or contents
  version adds the contents version its header states and the SDK its first two class names (`hkClass`, `hkClassMember`)
  belong to: `Havok 7.1.0-r1` (`14425E51`, `4A986551`), `Havok 2013.1 to 2014.2` (`33D42383`, `B0EFA719`: all 29 distinct
  packfiles of Sekiro and the 6 of Elden Ring, versions 9 and 11, contents versions `hk_2013.1.0-r1` and
  `hk_2014.1.0-r1`; the signatures do not tell those apart), or the two signatures as stored. The file version is read in
  the byte order the layout rules name: a little-endian file's version 11 was reported as 184549376, and a little-endian
  version 7 file as a wrong version instead of a wrong byte order.
- `RigidBody` reads `quality_type`, `allowed_penetration_depth`, `object_radius`, `linear_damping`, `angular_damping`,
  `inverse_inertia`, `inverse_mass`, `center_of_mass_local` and `gravity_factor`. A fixed body has no inverse inertia and
  no inverse mass and a dynamic one has all four positive; both velocities are zero; the swept transform's two centres
  of mass and two rotations are equal (12,789 bodies, 2,021 of them fixed).
- `ExtendedMesh` reads `welding_type`, `default_collision_filter_info`, `cached_num_child_shapes`, `triangle_radius` and
  `user_data`, and refuses a count above the triangle total, a shape-storage array that is not empty and non-zero
  padding at `+0xD9..+0xDC` and `+0xE8..+0xF0` (1,758 meshes).
- `ConvexVertices` reads `faces` from the shape's `hkpConvexVerticesConnectivity` (8,751 of 8,780 shapes; 255,593 faces
  over 1,420,968 indices) and refuses a count list that does not use every index once, an index that names no vertex, and
  fewer planes than faces. It also reads `user_data` and refuses a pointer at `+0x50` or non-zero bytes at `+0x64..+0x70`.
  The stored planes are still not checked for unit normals or containment: 221 shapes have one other normal length and
  222 have a vertex outside their planes.
- `MoppCode` (new) reads `hkpMoppCode`: `offset`, `scale`, `build_type` and the `code` bytes (1,705 codes, 5,917,936
  bytes); `Shape::Mopp` names its code.
- `Shape::Capsule` refuses end points whose fourth lanes are not the radius (96 capsules). `Shape::List` children are
  `ListChild`s (new) with the record's `collision_filter_info`; the record's other two words must be zero (41 records).
  Every shape object's `+0x0C` must be zero (15,935 shapes) and `shape_user_data` (new) reads `+0x08`.
- Breaking: `RigidBody`, `ExtendedMesh` and `ConvexVertices` have new public fields; `Shape::Mopp` has a new field
  `code` and `Shape::List::children` is a `Vec<ListChild>`; `physics::DECODED` has 13 entries and `RECOGNISED` 7 (the
  MOPP code and the convex connectivity move from the second to the first).

Tagfiles (`Tagfile`, `Type`, `cloth`):

- A member record's flags have `0x20` set and no bit outside `0x27` (816,249 records in 229 + 875 type tables:
  `0x20` to `0x25`); a type that stores a subtype is a pointer or an array by its own format or its nearest parent's
  (Sekiro 25,275 pointers and 20,192 arrays; Elden Ring 111,486 and 91,351, all by their own format); the records of a
  PTCH section ascend by type, one a type, and the offsets of a record ascend strictly (Sekiro 302,601 records over
  2,874,911 offsets; Elden Ring 1,114,489 over 7,516,964).
- `Cloth::target_platform` reads `hclClothData.targetPlatform`, 2 in all 610 + 2,692 of the distinct tagfiles. Breaking:
  `Cloth` has a new public field.

Tagfile writer (`Tagfile::image`, `TagfileImage`, `ImageItem`):

- `Tagfile::image` copies a tagfile into an editable `TagfileImage` (its type table as stored, and every item's bytes);
  `TagfileImage::write` emits a tagfile: the type section (`TYPE`, or the `TCRF` reference to a compendium) is written as
  it was read, and `DATA`, `ITEM` and `PTCH` are made from the item graph. The items are numbered and laid out by the
  rules the stock files follow (breadth first over runs, a queue of objects, strings numbered last; arrays on 16, strings
  on 2, objects on their alignment; the module documentation has them). A file read and written again, unedited, is the
  same bytes: all 19,137 distinct tagfiles of Sekiro (15,176 with a compendium, 3,960 with their own types, the one of SDK
  2015.1) and all 68,722 of Elden Ring (46,793 and 21,929). Editing is by `ImageItem::data`, `TagfileImage::set_reference`,
  `set_string` and `push_item`; items nothing refers to are not written.
- `Tagfile::item_at` finds the item and the position in it of a DATA offset (a `Value`'s `offset`).

## 0.6.0 (2026-10-27)

Bounding-volume trees. `compressed_mesh` decodes and checks both levels of a mesh's static tree and its simd tree, and
refuses a mesh whose trees do not hold together. Every compressed mesh of both installs' map, object and asset
collision passes (Sekiro 3,344 mesh trees and 273,228 section trees; Elden Ring 22,899 and 722,405).

- `BvTree::decode` and `mesh_trees`: the mesh tree (5-byte nodes, leaves are sections) and each section's tree
  (4-byte nodes, leaves are primitives) as `BvTree`s of `BvNode`s with their boxes (box rule: a nibble `n` takes
  `n^2 / 226` of the parent's extent from its side, the root from the tree's `domain`). Refused: a second child that is not
  a later node inside its subtree, a leaf that does not end its subtree (so a node unreached or reached twice), a domain
  that is not finite and ordered, leaves that do not cover `0..sections` / `0..numPrimitives` exactly once, a section
  whose `leafIndex` is not its leaf's node in the mesh tree.
- `CompressedMesh::bounds` (`BoundsCheck`): trees, nodes and leaves, and every triangle and quad tested against its
  leaf's box, within `BOUNDS_TOLERANCE_ULPS` (16 `f32` ULPs at the largest magnitude of the coordinate, the box and the
  tree's domain): a vertex outside is counted, not refused. None is outside in either install; the box rule leaves 13,490
  Sekiro and 18,577 Elden Ring boxes inverted on an axis by under 0.1 mm (`BoundsCheck::inverted_boxes`), also not a refusal.
- `simd_tree` and `CompressedMesh::simd` (`SimdCheck`): the four-lane `hkcdSimdTree` of `hknpCompressedMeshShapeData`
  (`SimdTree`, `SimdNode`, `SimdLane`), read in both games' encodings (Sekiro tags each lane's data word, Elden Ring flags
  the node). Refused: a first node that is not the empty sentinel, a lane whose box is empty where its data holds a child or leaf
  (or the reverse), a child that is not a later node, a node that is not the child of exactly one lane, leaves that are not the
  mesh's triangles, quads and custom primitives once each (a tree with no leaf is allowed), Elden Ring's `hasSimdTree`
  against the leaves. The boxes (a child lane's against the union below it, a leaf's against its primitive's vertices) are counted.
- `MeshSection::leaf_index` (new field): the node of the section's leaf in the mesh tree.
- Breaking: `CompressedMesh` and `MeshSection` have new public fields.
- Tests: hand-built trees and tagfile fixtures for every refusal; the real-data tests that read the corpora now read
  the trees too (`tests/corpus.rs`, `tests/paged_mesh.rs`). The install-wide counts are `tests/bvtree_census.rs` of
  `fromsoft-formats`.

## 0.5.0 (2026-10-27)

Float tracks, and the cutscene binders' rotations, read. A read of both installs (19,137 + 68,722 distinct tagfiles) now
parses all 60,209 spline animations, the 11,581 of Sekiro and 48,628 of Elden Ring, where 0.4.0 refused 608 for their
float track and 2 for a rotation float that is not finite.

- Breaking: `SplineAnimation::parse` reads float tracks. 66 Sekiro and 542 Elden Ring cutscene animations have one
  each, a camera's field of view (the binding drives the skeleton's one float slot, `camNNNN_FOV`). `SplineAnimation::floats`
  has the float tracks of each block as `FloatTrack`: `Static` (mask byte `0x03`, one f32; 946 blocks) or `Spline`
  (`0x12`, 16-bit control points between a stored lowest and highest value, with knots as a transform spline has them; 164
  blocks, degree 1 or 3). `sample_float` evaluates one at a time and `floats_at` poses a skeleton's float slots as
  `pose_at` poses its bones. Any other mask byte, and an animation with more than one float track (what pads between
  two has not been seen), is refused by name. `maskAndQuantizationSize` is checked against
  `round4(4 * transform tracks + float tracks)` (it holds in all 60,209 animations).
- Breaking: `Unreadable::point` (a new field) names the control point of a rotation spline. An uncompressed rotation
  with a float that is not finite is stored data, not a misread, and is read as stored and named in
  `SplineAnimation::unreadable` (`part` is `rotation`) instead of refusing the animation: Elden Ring's cutscenes
  `s12_05_0020` cut0040 and cut0060 each store one control point of four quiet NaNs (`0x7FC00000`) in the rotation
  spline of the wing bone `R_Wing_12`, among 248 and 255 finite unit quaternions, and the bytes around them parse to the
  block's exact end. `sample` refuses (an error, not a rotation) a time that blends such a point.
- Cutscene binders' rotations: Sekiro's 17,014 cutscene transform tracks all select quantization 1 (40 bit), Elden Ring's
  267,433 all select 5 (uncompressed); codes 0, 3 and 4 occur in no track of either install and stay refused.
- Tests: hand-built blocks with static and spline float tracks, the refused mask bytes, non-finite values and
  ranges, the mask size, the bytes after float data, the slot a binding names, and a rotation spline with a NaN
  control point (and a static one); a real-data test (`tests/float_tracks.rs`, inputs `corpus.sekiro/havok-float` and
  `corpus.elden/havok-float`, skipped without them) reads five cutscene tagfiles against values a separate walk of the
  block layout found.
- `extern_mesh` and `ExternMesh`: the triangles of an `hknpExternMeshShape` (the shape of every body of the map
  collision `f` binders), read from its `hknpDefaultExternMeshShapeGeometry` and `hkGeometry`: vertices (finite, fourth
  lane exactly 1), triangles (every index names a vertex) and their materials, and 2018.1's
  `useTriangleMaterialAsShapeTag`. A read of every `f` binder of both installs (12,688 Sekiro and 264,858 Elden Ring
  bodies, 539,652 + 2,233,804 vertices, 537,436 + 1,707,650 triangles) accepts every body.

## 0.4.0 (2026-10-27)

The checks that a census of every Sekiro and Elden Ring tagfile, type table and spline animation settled. Each new
refusal is of an input none of those files has: a read of both installs (19,137 + 68,722 distinct tagfiles, 16 + 36
compendia, 10,876 + 38,769 spline animations in the animation binders) accepts every one of them.

- Breaking: the type hash of every type that stores one (the THSH section) is checked against the hash the type's
  description gives, a chained CRC-32 over its parent, interfaces, format word, name, template parameters, version,
  size and alignment word, type flags and members (inherited ones included). Reproduced for all 20,180 stored hashes of
  Sekiro's 229 distinct type tables and all 90,033 of Elden Ring's 875; a mismatch is a refusal naming the type.
- Breaking: `Type::alignment` is the alignment (the low 12 bits of the stored word) and `Type::requested_alignment` the
  requested alignment (bits 12 to 15; 3 on `hkCompressedMassProperties`, 15 on `hkpConstraintAtom`, 0 on every other
  type); a word with bits above 15 is refused.
- Breaking: `Type::abstract_value: Option<u64>` is `Type::type_flags: Option<TypeFlags>`, the type's flags word as a
  bit set (presence bit 16 of `Type::flags` means "a flags word follows"). `TypeFlags` names the bits the two games
  store (1, 2, 16, 64, 128, 256).
- Breaking: `Item::flags: u8` is `Item::kind: ItemKind` (`Null`, `Object` for byte `0x10`, `Run` for `0x20`). Any other
  byte, or a nonzero byte on the null item, is refused.
- Breaking: `SDK_VERSIONS` has `20150100` (Sekiro's `c1090` clip `a000_205000`); the file's own type table gives its
  layouts, which differ from 2016.2's.
- A pointer, string or array slot is refused unless the bytes after its four-byte item index are zero (the size and
  capacity words of an `hkArray`, the high half of an eight-byte pointer).
- Breaking: `ReferenceFrame::frame_type` is gone: `frameType` is not serialised, and its stored value is 0 in every
  reference frame of both installs.
- Breaking: `RotationQuantization::Polar32` is gone and rotation quantization 0 is refused like 3 and 4: no transform
  track of either install selects it.
- `SplineAnimation::parse` accepts spline degrees 1 to 3 only (the games' files have degrees 1 and 3), refuses a
  `maskAndQuantizationSize` that is not the masks of the tracks, and accepts the 16 zero bytes after a block only after
  the animation's last block, whose last track's rotation is 40-bit and ends within two bytes of the block's padded end
  (4,975 Elden Ring blocks; no other block of either game has them).
- Tests: a hand-built type table whose hashes are the census recipe's (every component of the description changes its
  hash), a table that refers to itself, item kind bytes, reference slots with bytes after the index, a degree sweep, the
  mask size, and the trailing-byte rule with its negatives. A real-data test (`tests/sdk2015.rs`, input
  `corpus.sekiro/havok-2015`, skipped without it) reads the one 2015.1 clip.

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-27)

A fix to the shared vertices of the `l` collision sets, and the checks a census of every Sekiro and Elden Ring
collision binder and cloth file settled: each new refusal is of an input none of those files has.

- Fix: `compressed_mesh` ignored the section page. A section's shared-vertex index entries are 16 bits, and a section
  of page `p` addresses `sharedVertices[p * 65536 + entry]`; the reader used the entry alone, so a triangle with a
  shared vertex in such a section got another triangle's vertex. Pages 1 to 4 occur in the `l` sets only (89 Sekiro
  sections, 6,233 Elden Ring sections); 6,746 Sekiro and 347,611 Elden Ring triangles (the first triangle of each
  primitive) were decoded with wrong vertices. Every triangle of every collision mesh of both installs now equals an
  independent decode and lies inside its section's domain.
- `MeshSection::page` and `MeshSection::domain` (the section's `hkAabb`, minimum then maximum) are new, and
  `Value::element_size` gives an array value's element size from its type, empty or not.
- `compressed_mesh` refuses a tree whose `packedVertices`, `sharedVertices` or `sharedVerticesIndex` elements are not
  4, 8 and 2 bytes.
- `ConvexShape::read` refuses a polytope (a box, capsule, cylinder, triangle or polytope shape) with a different
  number of planes and faces.
- Breaking: cloth particle indices are 16-bit, as the files store them. `Link::particle_a`/`particle_b`,
  `LocalRange::particle`/`reference_vertex` are `u16` and `SimCloth::fixed_particles` is `Vec<u16>`; a file that stores
  them in another width is refused, and so is a fixed particle, a link or a local range particle that names a particle
  the sim cloth does not have.
- Breaking: `ConstraintSet::LocalRange::shape_type` is the enum `LocalRangeShape` (`Sphere` 0, `Cylinder` 1); any
  other stored value is refused.
- Tests: a synthetic tagfile builder (`tests/tagbuilder`); mesh trees of both SDK layouts with a section of page 1,
  the widths and an out-of-range page; polytope plane counts; link and local range sets with their index widths,
  bounds and shape types. A real-data test (`tests/paged_mesh.rs`, inputs `corpus.sekiro/havok-l` and
  `corpus.elden/havok-l`, skipped without them) decodes the one Sekiro and the one Elden Ring tagfile that have
  sections of page above 0 (89 and 6,233 sections, 6,980 and 507,001 triangles) and requires every triangle inside its
  section's domain: with the page ignored, 6,750 of the Sekiro triangles are not.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-27)

Packfile members are named as the class signatures the files store define them, and what a census of the 490 Tony
Hawk's SHRED packfiles and of every Sekiro and Elden Ring collision mesh shows is now checked on every file.

- Breaking: `RigidBody::collision_filter_info` is the collidable's filter word at `+0x2C`; the word at `+0xA8` is
  `storage_index` (u16) and `contactPointCallbackDelay` (checked `0xFFFF`).
- Breaking: `MeshMaterial` is `filter_info`, `restitution`, `friction` (halves, read as `f32`; any finite value is
  accepted, where `0x3F80` was required) and `user_data` (kept as stored).
- Breaking: `Packfile::flags` is `Packfile::filler` (version 7 has no field there); `Packfile::user_tag` is read.
- `Packfile::read` refuses a class whose stored signature differs from the one the corpus stores for its name
  (`CLASS_SIGNATURES`, 24 classes); `Packfile::class_names` lists the entries with their signatures.
- Extended meshes: the scaling must be `(1, 1, 1, 1)`, the embedded subpart a copy of subpart 0 (but for its triangle
  offset), and every unread subpart byte zero.
- `mesh_sections` refuses sections that do not tile the tree's arrays, and in 2016.2 a `sharedVertices.data` count that
  is not `numPackedVertices`; `MeshSection::shared_indices` is new, and `compressed_mesh` refuses a vertex index past
  the section's packed and shared vertices.
- `hkpMotion::MotionType` constants for all eight 7.1 values (behaviour unchanged: 2, 3 and 5 are read).
- Breaking: `AnimationType::ReferenceFrame` is `AnimationType::ReferencePose` (value 6, a reference-pose animation).
- THREECOMP40/48 rotations use the f32 nearest the exact step `1 / (n sqrt 2)` (a change of at most 12 ulp per step).
