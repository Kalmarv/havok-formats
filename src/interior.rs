//! The interior flags of a compressed mesh: [`interior_keys`] says which triangles a shape's `triangleIsInterior` field marks.
//!
//! What the field marks, and how a triangle gets there. This is the rule that reproduces the flags of every compressed mesh
//! of the Sekiro and Elden Ring installs that has any flag set (25,383,271 shape keys of 2,982 meshes and 65,846,233 of
//! 17,122) with no key wrong, from the decoded vertices alone (the tests of `fromsoft-formats` run it):
//!
//! 1. *Neighbours.* Every directed edge of a triangle is paired with the same two vertices in the opposite direction, if a
//!    triangle has them: by vertex identity (a packed vertex is named by its section and slot, a shared one by its entry
//!    in the shared-vertex index), the primitives taken in key order and a triangle's edges in vertex order (`a b`, `b c`,
//!    `c a`). A reversed edge that was already waiting is the one paired, the latest of them; an edge nobody pairs waits.
//!    The diagonal of a quad is the edge between its two halves, linked directly. A *flat* quad (see
//!    [`InteriorPrimitive::flat`]) is one polygon `a b c d` with four edges, the outer ones, and is flagged under its first
//!    half's key alone. A triangle or polygon with a missing neighbour on any edge is never flagged.
//! 2. *Convex edges.* An edge of a triangle, with `e` the unit direction of the edge (the next corner minus this one) and
//!    `m` the unit normal of the triangle across it, is *convex* when `e . (n x m)` is more than the single-precision
//!    epsilon, `n` being the triangle's own normal (the raw cross product of two edges in the ordering pass, the unit
//!    normal in the marking pass). Normals are `(b - a) x (c - a)`; a polygon's normal is that of its first three corners.
//! 3. *Order.* The triangles with all neighbours are put in ascending order of `|n| + 10 * (convex edges)` (`|n|` being
//!    twice the area) by the quicksort [`game_sort`] spells out: it is not stable, so the order of triangles of an equal
//!    value is part of the result.
//! 4. *Marking.* In that order a triangle is flagged unless one of its convex edges meets a triangle that is already
//!    flagged, or whose normal is more than 70 degrees from its own.
//!
//! All of it is single-precision arithmetic in the order the stock tool does it, with an estimate of the reciprocal
//! square root ([`rsqrt_estimate`], refined by one Newton step) in the unit vectors and the lengths. Whether an edge is
//! convex is often a difference of a few units in the last place, so the estimate matters: the table in
//! [`rsqrt_estimate`] is an approximation fitted from these flags (no other estimate tried reproduces them), not a copy of
//! a processor's table.
