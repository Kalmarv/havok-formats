//! Triangulating a simple polygon given by its corner positions in 3-space: [`triangulate`].
//!
//! A navigation face is a polygon of up to 91 corners (Sekiro's most is 31), not always convex (about 5 % of Sekiro's
//! faces and 2 % of Elden Ring's are not, seen from above) and not always planar (corners lie up to 1.4 m off the
//! face's mean plane), so a fan from one corner is wrong for some of them. The polygon is projected along its Newell
//! normal's largest axis and cut into triangles by ear clipping in that plane.
//!
//! This file uses only the standard library, so it can be read and run on its own.
