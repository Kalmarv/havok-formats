//! The bounding-volume trees of a compressed mesh: the *mesh tree* (5-byte nodes; its leaves are the sections) and each
//! section's *section tree* (4-byte nodes; its leaves are the section's primitives), decoded and checked.
//!
//! A tree is stored as a pre-order array of nodes, so every subtree is a contiguous run of nodes: the first child of an
//! internal node is the next node, its second child starts after the first child's subtree, and a leaf is the last node
//! of its subtree. A node holds a nibble pair per axis (the high nibble shrinks the box from its minimum side, the low
//! nibble from its maximum side, each by `extent × nibble² / 226` of the parent's extent) and a data word that names
//! either the second child or the leaf's payload. The root's box is the tree's `domain` shrunk by its own nibbles, which
//! are zero in all but a few percent of the Sekiro and Elden Ring trees.
//!
//! What the decoders refuse, and what they count instead, is documented on [`BvTree::decode`], [`mesh_trees`] and
//! [`BoundsCheck`].
