//! Which triangles the stock tool joins into quads. A quad primitive stores four vertices `[a, b, c, d]` and stands for the
//! triangles `a b c` and `a c d`; the two halves share the diagonal `c a`, which is the third edge of the first and the
//! first edge of the second. The rule below was read off the stock meshes (see the engine wiki's page on Havok collision
//! for the census): it picks the same pairs as the stock tool for 99.4% of the stock quads of Sekiro and 99.2% of Elden
//! Ring's (a pair counted when both triangles are the same two source triangles), and for every stock quad it picks, it
//! puts the same triangle first.
//!
//! 1. The triangles of one group (the stock tool does this per section) give each distinct vertex position a number, in
//!    the order the triangles first use it. Every triangle contributes its three edges as records `(lower number, higher
//!    number, triangle, edge)`, the edge `n` running from corner `n` to the next one.
//! 2. The records are sorted by the two numbers with the stock tool's quicksort ([`game_sort_by`]); that sort is not stable,
//!    so which of several triangles on one edge comes first follows from its procedure.
//! 3. For each record in turn, the first later record with the same two numbers that fits makes a candidate: the other
//!    triangle runs the edge the other way, has another vertex opposite it, has the same primitive data, and the two edges
//!    are a third edge and a first edge (so the first half of the quad is the triangle whose third edge is shared).
//! 4. A candidate costs the increase of box surface the pair brings: for the two triangles' boxes `A` and `B` and the box
//!    `U` of both, `(U - B) + (U - A)` with a box's surface taken as `ez*ey + ey*ex + ex*ez` of its extents, all in `f32`.
//!    The candidates are sorted by cost with the same quicksort and taken in that order, skipping one whose triangle is
//!    taken already.
//!
//! Where the stock tool differs: among edges that many (eight or more) triangles share, the stock pairs are not always the
//! ones the order of the records gives; the Sekiro object meshes, which have most of those, come out at 88.7%.
