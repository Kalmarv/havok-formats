//! Names for the values of the enumerated members the games' Havok files store as numbers.
//!
//! Each enumeration is a Rust enum with the value the files store ([`value`](hkp::MotionType::value)), the SDK's
//! name for it ([`name`](hkp::MotionType::name)) and the way back ([`from_value`](hkp::MotionType::from_value), `None`
//! for a value the enumeration does not name). Where the files hold only some of the named values the variant says
//! which, with the counts of a census of every distinct tagfile of Sekiro (19,127 read; 11 more need a compendium that
//! lies in another binder) and Elden Ring (68,722) and every one of the 490 packfiles of Tony Hawk's SHRED. A member that a type table marks
//! as not serialisable (declaration flag [`DeclFlags::NOT_SERIALIZABLE`](crate::DeclFlags::NOT_SERIALIZABLE)) stores
//! no value: its bytes are zero in every object of both installs, and the enumeration's zero is then no information.
//!
//! The names come from the sources that allow it. The 7.1 `hkp` enumerations of the SHRED packfiles that carry their
//! own class metadata ([`MotionType`](hkp::MotionType), [`ResponseType`](hkp::ResponseType),
//! [`BroadPhaseType`](hkp::BroadPhaseType)) are the metadata's own: the eight files list every item, and
//! `tests/enums.rs` compares them with these variants. The others of `hkp` are the 6.6 SDK headers' (their numbering
//! agrees with what the 7.1 files hold: no `hkp` enumeration of those headers is stored with other values). The
//! 2014 and later tagfiles name the enumerations of their members but list no items (Sekiro: 160 of 160 type tables
//! that describe `hkaAnimation`; Elden Ring: 660 of 660), so the `hka`, `hknp` and `hcl` names are those of HKLib's 2018.1
//! classes (MIT), each one tested against the class that stores the value (`hknpShape`'s type against its class, for
//! example).
//!
//! A value that no file stores is still named when its source names it; the variant's documentation says it occurs in
//! no file.
